# Image-Caption-Generation-using-CNN-and-LSTM-Architecture
This project uses a CNN-LSTM architecture to generate descriptive captions for images, bridging computer vision and natural language processing. The goal is to create a system that is particularly valuable for individuals with visual impairments by enabling them to comprehend visual content they cannot directly perceive.
